# Car-Sell
Welcome to the Car-Sell , a comprehensive web application featuring a Node.js backend with MongoDB, providing RESTful APIs for car dealerships.
This project encompasses secure authentication, role-based access, and seamless integration with a SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS frontend.
# Backend
The backend server is built in Node.js, utilizing the MongoDB native driver for database interactions. 
This server focuses on creating RESTful APIs, implementing authentication, asynchronous error handling using promises, and ensuring ACID compliance with transaction management.
Projections are employed to enhance data privacy in REST endpoints.
# Frontend
Svelte is a lightweight JavaScript framework that compiles components at build time for efficient DOM updates. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that uses pre-defined classes for styling.
Together, they enable rapid development of modern web applications with minimal overhead and improved performance.
Svelte's component-based approach pairs seamlessly with Tailwind's utility classes, resulting in a streamlined development experience and consistent design language across projects.
